        <p>I grew up in a small town in Indiana where I learned to type by using AOL Instant Messenger. I went to college at Ohio University where I landed in the College of Business majoring in Marketing and minoring in failing accounting and stats classes. Additionally, I was the President of Delta Tau Delta Fraternity, had a part time job working for the Intramural Sports Deparment (best job ever) and spent a summer in Colorado interning at Crocs.</p>

            <p>After graduation, I started my career with CareStar, Inc. in Cincinnati as a marketing person. I learned the basics of web design and developement and was HOOKED. Convinced that Austin was a better place for tech-minded folks who wanted to make a difference, I packed up and bailed to Texas in March of 2012. The minute I got to Austin I started learning how to truly build sites and products with code and not just dump content into a WYSIWYG and hit "Save."</p>

            <p>During the summer of 2012, <a href="http://capitalfactory.com" target="blank">Capital Factory</a> brought me on as an Event Coordinator where I helped keep the lights on and bring events into the amazing 22,000 square foot startup hub. In January 2013 I started with Paperless Pipeline as a Customer Advocate working with customers to answer questions and help market the product. In September of that year I left Pipeline to work as a freelancer and help startups with design and web development.</p>

            <p>Throughout 2014 I worked with startups and entrepreneurs in many ways. Through the first few months I was contracted with <a href="https://cratejoy.com">Cratejoy</a> to help build some of the original stores on their platform. In the summer, I was brought on to be a "hackstar" for the <a href="http://techstars.com">Techstars</a> in Austin program helping all the companies involved with design and development where needed. And in the last portion of the year, I was contracted by <a href="http://startuprunner.com">StartupRunner</a> to help with design, development and project management for their portfolio companies.</p>
