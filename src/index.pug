      p Hello and welcome, internet user! I currently am a Front End Engineer at The Zebra in Austin, Texas. I spend a lot of time working on web sites and hanging out with my girlfriend and our dog walking around town. This site acts as a testing ground for ideas I have whether it be through code, words or something else. Keep scrolling to continue learning about me and my projects. Please a(href='/#contact') click here if you would like to contact me.
